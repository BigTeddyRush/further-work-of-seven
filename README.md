# Branch: `semantic-selection`

This branch presents the results of running Prover E using only **semantic axiom selection**.

The configuration isolates the semantic selection strategy to evaluate its individual impact on proof discovery and performance, without any syntactic selection or additional core axioms.

These results serve as a baseline for understanding the role of semantic guidance in comparison to other strategies, such as syntactic selection or combined approaches found in the `enhanced-mode` branch.

Feel free to browse the data, and reach out if you have any questions or would like further details on the setup.
