# Branch: `enhanced-mode`

This branch contains the results for an enhanced configuration that combines both syntactic and semantic selection strategies, along with additional core axioms.

It is not a native mode of Prover E, but rather a custom setup designed to evaluate the impact of combining advanced selection techniques with an enriched axiom set.

The data here can be used for comparison with standard modes such as `--auto`, `--satauto`, or other custom configurations.

Feel free to explore the results, and reach out if you have any questions or comments.
