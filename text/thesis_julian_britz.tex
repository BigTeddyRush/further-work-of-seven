%
%
% Language of the thesis:
%
% You must use either 'german' or 'english' above, depending on the
% language used in the main text. This will automatically setup a lot
% of things in the background.
%
%
% Version of the class:
%
% You must specify which version of the thesis class is to be
% used. This is important in case the class style changes in later
% years, but we still want an older thesis to look the same, even when
% things are changed in the class.
%
% Do not change or remove the version-xxxx key.
%
%
% Text encoding:
%
% Your thesis *must* be encoded in utf8 (unicode), which is the
% default in most editors these days. Do *not* change this to latin8.



%%%
%
% Main setup:
%
%%%
%
% You must use the \UzLThesisSetup command to specify numerous things
% about your thesis. This includes the entries on the title page, the 
% abstracts, and the bibliography style. You do so by specifying
% so-called "values" for so-called "keys". For instance, 
% for the key "Autor" you must provide your name as the value. You do
% so by writing 'Autor = {Max Mustermann}', that is, the value is put
% into curly braces. You can use the \UzLThesisSetup command
% repeatedly and the order in which you provide the keys is not
% important. 
%
% Everything shown on the title page must be in German -- even
% if the thesis is written in English! Just insert German text for
% German keys and English text for English keys (like 'Abstract' needs
% English text, while 'Zusammenfassung' needs German text).

  % First, specify the institut or clinic at which the thesis was
  % written. You get the logo file from them (make sure it has the
  % correct size, namely the same as the example). If they do not have
  % a logo, the university's default logo is used.
  %
  % The 'verfasst' gets two arguments. Change the first to {an der}

  % thesis was mainly written 'externally' at some company or another
  % institute, point this out using 'Weitere Unterstützung'. 
  % 
  % For your own name, do *not* add things like "BSc" or "BSc

% Styling the thesis
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Creating a visually pleasing layout and choosing fonts is not
% easy. Furthermore, different people have different preferences. Of
% course, for the University of Lübeck, the dean of studies could just
% force everyone to use one specific layout and font, but that seems a
% bit drastic and, also, it seems nice that thesis by different people
% have an individual style even though they all stick to the same
% overall structure.
%
% For these reasons, I (Till Tantau) have spend quite some time on
% designing a flexible layout and styling mechanism for theses.
%
% Basically, the overall structure of the thesis is fixed by the
% thesis class and so are many structural elements. For instance, you
% cannot change the order in which the abstract and table of contents
% are shown, you cannot move the bibliography elsewhere, indeed, the
% bibliography style is also fixed. Likewise, the text on the title
% page is fixed.
%
% Although many things are fixed, you *can* change several other
% things. For instance, you can change the font used for the main
% text, you can change which font is used for titles and headings or
% you can change whether titles and headlines are centered or flushed
% left.
%
% There are many LaTeX packages for changing such things. You are
% kindly asked *not to use them*. Rather, use (only) the options
% offered by the thesis class. All possible choices and combinations
% there have been tested by me and produce nice results; what happens
% with other packages no one knows and might no longer conform to what
% is expected by the university. As you will see, you still have a
% lot of options.
%
%
% Technical note: All styling is done via the command
%
% \UzLStyle{...}
%
% where ... is a key-value list just as for \UzLThesisSetup. The
% difference is just that everything having to do with styling as
% controlled by \UzLStyle, while the more “formal” setup keys are
% controlled by \UzLThesisSetup.
%
%%%
%
% Designs
%
%
% A \emph{design} is a whole set of font and layout options bundled
% together. They have been chosen in such a way that a visually
% pleasing “overall appearance” results.
%
%
% \UzLStyle{computer modern oldschool design}
%
% The look of this design mimics the “classical” way a paper or report
% created with \LaTeX\ looks like: The Computer Modern font is used,
% bold face fonts are used for headlines, only black and white are
% used as colors. This design reminds me of older scientific
% documents, especially from the computer science community where
% \LaTeX\ was used very early.
%
%
% \UzLStyle{computer modern basic design}
%
% A slightly less “oldschool” version of the previous design. It is
% still a classic design in the sense that it uses the Computer Modern
% font and that it still has this “good old \LaTeX” look, but some
% more modern aspects (like colors!) have been added.
%
% Note that this design uses Myriad for the title page (one of the
% “modern aspect”), which means that his font must be installed.
%
%
% \UzLStyle{computer modern scholary design}
%
% In my opinion, this is the ultimate “scholary design”: The thesis
% will look like it has been typeset by hand some 150 years ago and
% then printed by a university press. There is really nothing “modern”
% about it and the word in the name of the design is just part of the
% name of the “Computer Modern” font.
%
%
% \UzLStyle{pagella basic design}
%
% A, well, basic design that uses the Pagella font rather than the
% Computer Modern font. Especially the bold face version of this font
% looks nicer than the Computer Modern counterpart. Also, Pagella,
% while still having a “bookish” look, still feels a bit fresher than
% Computer Modern. 
%
%
% \UzLStyle{pagella centered design}
%
% A variant of the basic Pagella design that centers all
% headlines. A nice alternative to the basic version.
%
%
% \UzLStyle{pagella contrast design}
%
% This design tries to create some visual friction by contrasting the
% sans serif headline font (in bold!) with the main text. I find it a
% visually very interesting combination.
%
%
% \UzLStyle{alegrya basic design}
%
% The third variant of the basic design, this time using the Alegrya
% font. 
%
%
% \UzLStyle{alegrya scholary design}
%
% The Alegrya version of the previous “scholary” design. Unlike the
% Computer Modern version, this design does not look old, but more
% fresh -- while still creating the impression that the text must be
% about a very scientific subject. 
%
%
% \UzLStyle{alegrya stylish design}
%
% The design is quite similar to the scholary version for the Alegrya
% font, but with even more modern additions. “Stylish” is the word
% that comes to my mind.
%
%
\UzLStyle{alegrya modern design}
%
% A design that uses the sans serif version of the Alegrya font for
% the headlines. This is a nice modern overall design.

\section{Introduction}

In this thesis, we investigate how adding frequently used axioms ("core axioms") to a subset of the Adimen SUMO grammar, selected based on a combination of syntactic and semantic criteria, enhances the success rate of automated theorem proving.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Given a formal logical grammar, such as Adimen SUMO, and a conjecture $C$, we aim to determine a subset of axioms that maximizes the probability of proving $C$.
    \item We use a combination of syntactic and semantic similarity measures to select an initial set of relevant axioms $\mathcal{A}_{\text{rel}}$.
    \item We hypothesize that augmenting this set with frequently used axioms $\mathcal{A}_{\text{core}}$ further improves proof success.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Entanglement Between Natural Language and Logical Grammar}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We do not assume a direct mapping $f: \mathcal{L}_{\text{NL}} \to \mathcal{L}_{\text{logic}}$ between natural language ($\mathcal{L}_{\text{NL}}$) and formal logic ($\mathcal{L}_{\text{logic}}$).
    \item Instead, we propose an \textbf{entanglement hypothesis}, where natural language and logical structures influence each other:
    \begin{equation}
        \mathcal{L}_{\text{NL}} \bowtie \mathcal{L}_{\text{logic}}
    \end{equation}
    \item Adimen SUMO, partially derived from WordNet, reflects structured knowledge from natural language.
    \item Natural language inherently follows logical structures, even if it remains ambiguous and context-dependent.
    \item Language models like SBERT capture semantic relationships, supporting the idea that formal logical expressions share deep structural similarities with natural language.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Necessity of Adding Core Axioms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To find a proof, semantic similarity alone is insufficient because logical reasoning relies on structural dependencies and inferential steps that may not be directly encoded in semantic embeddings.
    \item Theorem provers require axioms that establish intermediate logical connections because of the nature of theorem proving:
    \item Operation of Theorem Prover E
    To better understand the importance of intermediate axioms, consider how a theorem prover like E operates:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Input and Preprocessing}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Parsing of input axioms and conjectures into a logical syntax.
            \item Conversion of formulas into conjunctive normal form (CNF) for uniformity.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Indexing}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Clause indexing for efficient retrieval.
            \item Use of structures like discrimination trees for quick unification and resolution.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Main Proof Search Loop}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Selection of clauses using strategies based on heuristics.
            \item Application of inference rules such as resolution and paramodulation.
            \item Simplification and subsumption of inferred clauses.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Proof State Management}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Balancing expansion and reduction of search space.
            \item Employing search heuristics to efficiently explore the proof space.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Proof Search Termination}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Success: Derivation of a contradiction clause indicating a proof.
            \item Failure: Resource exhaustion without finding a proof.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Output Generation}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Generation of a proof object showing applied inference rules.
            \item Provision of a proof trace and performance statistics.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A proof is not simply a similarity-based retrieval task but requires chaining multiple inference steps to reach the desired conclusion.
        \item Many proofs require bridging axioms, which provide necessary intermediate logical steps between known premises and the conjecture.
        \item Without these bridging axioms, a theorem prover may fail to construct a proof, even if it has access to semantically relevant axioms.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The absence of intermediate axioms results in gaps in the inference chain, preventing the prover from reaching the conclusion.
    \item Empirical evidence from theorem proving suggests that missing such axioms often leads to failed proof attempts.
    \item Core axioms provide frequently used logical rules and bridges that help complete reasoning chains.
    \item Without these core axioms, proofs may fail due to missing key inference steps, even if semantically similar axioms are present.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Formal Hypothesis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Define:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\mathcal{A}$: The set of all axioms in Adimen SUMO.
        \item $C$: A conjecture to be proven.
        \item $d: \mathcal{A} \times C \to \mathbb{R}^+$: A similarity function measuring syntactic and semantic closeness.
        \item $\mathcal{A}_{\text{rel}}$: The subset of $k$ nearest axioms to $C$:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{A}_{\text{rel}} = \{ A \in \mathcal{A} \mid A \text{ is among the } k \text{ closest axioms to } C \text{ w.r.t. } d \}
        \end{equation}
        \item $\mathcal{A}_{\text{core}}$: A set of frequently used axioms in previous proofs.
        \item $\mathcal{A}_{\text{enh}} = \mathcal{A}_{\text{rel}} \cup \mathcal{A}_{\text{core}}$: The enhanced axiom set.
        \item $P(T, \mathcal{A}', C)$: A function that returns $\text{True}$ if theorem prover $T$ finds a proof of $C$ using $\mathcal{A}'$, otherwise $\text{False}$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Hypothesis:
    \begin{equation}
        \forall C \in \mathcal{C}, \quad \Pr(P(T, \mathcal{A}_{\text{enh}}, C) = \text{True}) > \Pr(P(T, \mathcal{A}_{\text{rel}}, C) = \text{True})
    \end{equation}
    \item This suggests that the success probability of proving $C$ increases when $\mathcal{A}_{\text{core}}$ is included.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Justification and Implications}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Since Adimen SUMO’s grammar is \textbf{entangled} with natural language structures, selecting axioms using semantic embeddings (e.g., SBERT) captures implicit logical dependencies.
    \item Frequently used axioms act as \textbf{structural anchors} within this entanglement, improving proof discovery.
    \item The theorem prover benefits from both the \textbf{nearest axioms} and the \textbf{core axioms}, leading to an overall higher proof success rate.
\end{itemize}

This thesis aims to empirically validate this hypothesis by evaluating proof success rates with different axiom selection strategies and demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating core axioms.

    \section{How WhiteboxTests are made}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Paper of Álvez about building WhiteBox Tests \cite{Álvez2017}
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item In the context of Adimen SUMO, \textbf{falsity tests} are formulated by taking specific statements or conditions and applying \textbf{negation} to them.
          \item These negated statements serve as a basis for falsity tests, which are essential in logical proof systems.
          \item A \textbf{theorem prover} such as Prover E then performs a process known as \textbf{refutation}.
          \item Through refutation, the theorem prover attempts to demonstrate the \textbf{inconsistency} or \textbf{falsehood} of the original statements.
          \item This is achieved by attempting to derive a \textbf{contradiction} from the negated statements, indicating that the original (non-negated) statements cannot all be true simultaneously.

          Why Would Provable Conjectures Have Lower Axiom Similarity? This suggests that proving the conjecture involves bridging different concepts, rather than just refining a single closely related idea.

% Normally, the bibliography comes next at this point. Do *not* (try
% to) include further indices and tables like an index or
% a list of figures or a list of tables or such things. Nobody
% actually uses them and they just use up space. 
%
% You *can* however include a glossary, if this seems appropriate. It
% goes here as an unnumbered chapter. Most thesis will *not* need a
% glossary: a well-written text (re)explains strange words and
% concepts as necessary. However, there are situations where a
% glossary may be helpful.

%
% The uzl-thesis class will load biblatex for the bibliography
% management. This is a powerful package, see its documentation for
% details. The styles will be setup correctly and automatically by
% choosing one of the two style keys as described earlier.
%
% In order for the bibliography to work, run latex in the following
% order (which is the standard order):
% 
% > lualatex thesis-example
% > bibtex thesis-example
% > lualatex thesis-example
% 
% Add BibTeX files using \addbibresource or use the {bibtex entries}
% environment (see below).
%
%%%
%
% Although everyting is normally setup automatically, you can change
% the options passed to biblatex using the key 'biblatex';
% for instance,
%
%   \UzLThesisSetup{biblatex={firstinits=false}}
%
% will switch off shortened first names. Normally, you will not need
% this key in your preamble. 
% 
% Note that the bibtex program is used as the 'backend' of biblatex
% by default (rather than biber, which is the preferred program of
% biblatex). This means that you can (and must) run *bibtex* after you
% have run lualatex on your thesis. If you wish to use biber instead
% of bibtex, say 'biblatex={backend=biber}'. 
% 
%%%
%
% The following environment is optional. It allows you to keep the
% bibtex entries for your thesis right here in the thesis file. What
% happens is that each time this tex file is processed, the contents
% of the following environment gets written to the file
% \jobname-bibtex-entries.bib (this file gets overwritten each
% time). Independently, \addbibresource{\jobname-bibtex-entries.bib}
% is always called if the file \jobname-bibtex-entries.bib
% exists. 
%
% In result, you can edit and keep the bibliography's bibtex entries
% right here. If you change something here, run latex, then bibtex,
% then latex once more.
%
% If you would like to manage the bibtex entries in a separate file,
% remove the below environment, delete the \jobname-bibtex-entries.bib
% file and instead write
%
% \addbibresource{filename-of-your-bibtex-file.bib}
%
% in the preamble.

  abstract="In the field of automated reasoning, practical applications often face a significant challenge: knowledge bases are typically too large to be fully processed by theorem provers. To still be able to prove that a given goal follows from a large knowledge base, selection techniques are used to determine the parts of the knowledge base that are relevant to the goal. Traditional selection techniques used for this task are usually syntax-based and often overlook a crucial aspect---the meaning of symbol names and axioms. Especially in commonsense reasoning scenarios, the meaning embedded in the symbol names provides invaluable insights. For example, in a proof task using the symbol name cow, it intuitively makes more sense to select formulae using the symbol name calf than formulae using the symbol name weapon. To address this gap, our paper introduces a selection technique that exploits the capabilities of large language models. This technique focuses on contextually related formulae, closely aligning the selected part of the knowledge base with the context of the goal. The approach is implemented and we present a series of experiments that show promising results.",

This is confirmed by the fact that the largest available first-order knowledge base (the Open CYC) contains over 3 million axioms, while answering queries to it usually requires not more than a few dozen axioms. A method for axiom selection has been proposed by the first author in the Sumo INference Engine (SInE) system. SInE has won the large theory division of CASC in 2008. The method turned out to be so successful that the next two years it was used by the winner as well as by several other competing systems. This paper contains the presentation of the method and describes experiments with it in the theorem prover Vampire.",
