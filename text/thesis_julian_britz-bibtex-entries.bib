  abstract="In the field of automated reasoning, practical applications often face a significant challenge: knowledge bases are typically too large to be fully processed by theorem provers. To still be able to prove that a given goal follows from a large knowledge base, selection techniques are used to determine the parts of the knowledge base that are relevant to the goal. Traditional selection techniques used for this task are usually syntax-based and often overlook a crucial aspect---the meaning of symbol names and axioms. Especially in commonsense reasoning scenarios, the meaning embedded in the symbol names provides invaluable insights. For example, in a proof task using the symbol name cow, it intuitively makes more sense to select formulae using the symbol name calf than formulae using the symbol name weapon. To address this gap, our paper introduces a selection technique that exploits the capabilities of large language models. This technique focuses on contextually related formulae, closely aligning the selected part of the knowledge base with the context of the goal. The approach is implemented and we present a series of experiments that show promising results.",

  abstract="One possible way to deal with large theories is to have a good selection method for relevant axioms. This is confirmed by the fact that the largest available first-order knowledge base (the Open CYC) contains over 3 million axioms, while answering queries to it usually requires not more than a few dozen axioms. A method for axiom selection has been proposed by the first author in the Sumo INference Engine (SInE) system. SInE has won the large theory division of CASC in 2008. The method turned out to be so successful that the next two years it was used by the winner as well as by several other competing systems. This paper contains the presentation of the method and describes experiments with it in the theorem prover Vampire.",

The selection is determined by semantics of the axioms and conjecture, ordered heuristically by a syntactic relevance measure. The system is able to solve many problems that cannot be solved alone by the underlying conventional automated reasoning system.",
